What is PEP 8? - Have you ever wondered the style your Python code should follow? things like how many spaces, blank lines, or what indentation should you use? what to name variables or functions? or just, how to make it look better and simpler, so it is easier to read and understand?

The answer to this question might be quite simple to some, but to others that have just taken a dive into learning how to code, might not be so obvious.

PEP stands for Python Enhance Proposal; these are design documents that provide information or describe new features of python. At Index 8 you can find the “Style Guide for Python Code”, hence the name PEP 8. You can check this out at Python.org - PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/.

PEP 8 covers formatting, comments, naming conventions, and provides recommendations and useful tips on various topics. Standardizing your code to PEP 8 guidelines will make it easier for others to collaborate and will even help you understand what you wrote when revisiting an old project.

Luckily, Python is a well-documented language, and there are tons of resources and videos where the PEP 8 Style guide is explained. So, you are a short google (or bing) search away!

Does the Official PEP 8 guide seems a bit difficult to digests? Real Python has put together a guide on “How to write Beautiful Python Code with PEP 8” where they go throughout the Style Guide in bite-size pieces with easy to follow examples.
